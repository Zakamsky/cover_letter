Hello Bill.

My name is Alex.

I know you are looking for a frontend (Markup) developer to work with Shopify.

I have a lot of experience in the e-commerce domain, working with CMS, like Prestashop, WordPress, Drupal, and various template engines.

I also know a little about Angular and React.

Now I am looking for a job in Spain, and open to moving or a remote job.
Please consider my resume.
